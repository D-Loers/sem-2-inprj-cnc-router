i chose for the mpu9250 because it has an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. that means that for the application of the mpu9250 it is very accurate because it has multiple sensors.

the mpu9250 works over i2c so it needs to be connected to the 5v, ground, scl and sda pins in order to work. 

the code used is mainly from a library that was used, this library is the mpu9250 library from Hideaki Tai. this library is quite simple and has easy to understand methods.
