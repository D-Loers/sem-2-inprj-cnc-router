i chose for the ADXL345 because this is an accelerometer with no added unecessary features and is an accurate accelerometer.

the ADXL345 works over i2c so it was easy to compare it to the MPU9250.

the code used for testing is mainly from a library, however i have added some modifications to determine the position of the accelerometer.
